            <p>
                When severe weather strikes, your roof stands as your home's first line of defense. High winds, heavy rain, hail, and fallen debris can cause immediate damage that requires prompt attention to prevent further harm to your property. Our storm damage repair services provide fast, professional response when you need it most, protecting your home from additional damage and beginning the restoration process quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand the stress and urgency that follow storm events. Our experienced team responds promptly to assess damage, implement emergency protection measures, and execute comprehensive repairs that restore your roof's integrity.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Common Types of Storm Damage We Repair</h2>
            <p>
                Pacific Northwest weather patterns create various types of roof damage. Recognizing these issues and addressing them quickly prevents minor storm damage from escalating into major structural problems.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Wind Damage</h3>
            <p>
                Strong winds can lift shingles, damage flashing, tear off roof sections, and drive rain into vulnerable areas. Wind damage often appears subtle initially but compromises your roof's weather protection. We assess wind damage thoroughly, identifying both obvious and hidden issues that require repair.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Water Intrusion and Leaks</h3>
            <p>
                Heavy rain following storm damage can cause immediate water intrusion. Active leaks demand urgent attention to prevent interior damage, insulation saturation, and mold growth. Our emergency response includes temporary water mitigation followed by permanent repairs that restore complete weather protection.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Hail Damage</h3>
            <p>
                Hail impacts can bruise or crack shingles, damage flashing, and compromise your roof's protective granule layer. While hail damage may not cause immediate leaks, it reduces your roof's remaining lifespan and weather resistance. We provide thorough hail damage assessments and work with insurance adjusters to document all damage.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Fallen Tree and Debris Damage</h3>
            <p>
                Trees, branches, and storm debris can puncture roofing materials, damage structural components, and create immediate openings for water intrusion. We provide emergency tarping services to protect your home while coordinating debris removal and executing necessary repairs.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Our Storm Damage Repair Process</h2>
            <p>
                Effective storm damage repair requires systematic assessment, immediate protection measures, and comprehensive repairs that restore your roof to full functionality.

                When you contact us about storm damage, we respond quickly to assess the situation and implement emergency measures. This includes tarping exposed areas, securing loose materials, and taking immediate steps to prevent additional damage while permanent repairs are planned.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Comprehensive Damage Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                We conduct thorough inspections to identify all storm-related damage, including issues that may not be immediately visible. This complete assessment ensures repairs address every problem, preventing future issues from hidden damage that went undetected.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Detailed Documentation for Insurance</h3>
            <p>
                Storm damage repairs often involve insurance claims. We provide thorough documentation including photographs, detailed damage descriptions, and accurate repair estimates. This documentation supports your claim and helps ensure you receive appropriate coverage for necessary repairs.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Professional Repair Execution</h3>
            <p>
                Once assessment and insurance documentation are complete, we execute repairs using quality materials and proven techniques. Our repairs restore your roof's structural integrity, weather protection, and appearance while meeting or exceeding all building codes.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Final Inspection and Verification</h3>
            <p>
                After completing repairs, we conduct final inspections to verify that all storm damage has been properly addressed and your roof provides complete protection. We ensure you're confident in the repairs before considering the project complete.
            </p>

            <p>
                The period immediately following a storm is critical. Prompt professional assessment and repair prevent minor damage from escalating into major problems. Even if damage seems minor, professional inspection can identify issues that homeowners often miss.
