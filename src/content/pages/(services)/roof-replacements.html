            <p>
                Your roof protects everything beneath it—your family, your belongings, and your home's structural integrity. When repairs no longer provide adequate protection, a complete roof replacement becomes essential. Our roof replacement services deliver durable, weather-resistant roofing systems designed to perform for decades.
            </p>
            
            <h2>When Your Home Needs a Complete Roof Replacement</h2>
            <p>
                Not every roofing issue requires a full replacement, but certain conditions make it the right choice. A complete roof replacement becomes necessary when your existing roof shows extensive damage, reaches the end of its lifespan, or no longer provides reliable protection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Signs you may need a roof replacement include widespread shingle damage, consistent leaks in multiple areas, sagging sections, or a roof approaching 20-25 years old. Rather than investing in frequent repairs that only address symptoms, a new roof provides comprehensive, long-term protection.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Our Comprehensive Roof Replacement Process</h2>
            <p>
                We approach every roof replacement with precision and care, ensuring your new roof performs exactly as intended from day one.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Thorough Inspection and Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                Before beginning any work, we conduct a complete roof inspection to assess your current roof's condition, identify any underlying structural issues, and determine the best replacement approach for your specific situation. This thorough evaluation ensures we address every aspect of your roofing system.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Complete Tear-Off and Preparation</h3>
            <p>
                A proper roof replacement begins with complete removal of your existing roofing materials down to the deck. This allows us to inspect the roof deck for any damage, make necessary repairs, and create a clean, stable foundation for your new roof. We also ensure proper ventilation and address any moisture issues discovered during tear-off.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Quality Materials and Expert Installation</h3>

            </p>

            <h3>Asphalt Shingles</h3>
            <p>
