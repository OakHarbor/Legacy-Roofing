            <p>
                Metal roofing represents one of the most durable, energy-efficient, and long-lasting roofing choices available. With proper installation, a metal roof can protect your home for 50 years or more while reducing energy costs, requiring minimal maintenance, and enhancing your property's distinctive appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our metal roof installation services combine precision craftsmanship with quality materials to deliver roofing systems that perform exceptionally in all weather conditions while providing lasting value for your investment.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Why Choose Metal Roofing</h2>
            <p>
                Metal roofing offers distinct advantages that make it an increasingly popular choice for residential and commercial properties throughout the Pacific Northwest.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Exceptional Longevity</h3>
            <p>
                While traditional asphalt shingles typically last 20-25 years, properly installed metal roofs regularly exceed 50 years of reliable performance. This extended lifespan means you may never need another roof replacement, making metal roofing a smart long-term investment.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Superior Weather Resistance</h3>
            <p>
                Metal roofs withstand harsh weather conditions that challenge other roofing materials. They resist wind uplift, shed snow and ice effectively, repel heavy rain, and won't deteriorate from moisture exposure. For Pacific Northwest properties facing constant rain and occasional severe weather, metal roofing provides exceptional protection.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Energy Efficiency</h3>
            <p>
                Metal roofing's reflective properties reduce heat absorption, keeping your home cooler in summer and reducing air conditioning costs. Many metal roofing products feature specialized coatings that further enhance energy efficiency, potentially qualifying for energy-efficiency incentives.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Low Maintenance Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike roofing materials that require regular maintenance, metal roofs need minimal attention. They don't absorb moisture, resist algae and moss growth, and maintain their appearance and performance with only occasional cleaning.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Environmental Benefits</h3>
            <p>
                Metal roofing contains recycled content and remains fully recyclable at the end of its long service life. Its durability also means fewer replacements, reducing construction waste over time.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Metal Roofing Options We Install</h2>
            
            <h3>Standing Seam Metal Roofing</h3>
            <p>
                Standing seam systems feature vertical panels with raised seams that interlock to create a watertight barrier. This premium option provides clean, modern aesthetics with superior performance. The concealed fastener system eliminates penetrations through the roofing surface, enhancing weather resistance and longevity.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Metal Shingles and Tiles</h3>
            <p>
                Metal shingles and tiles replicate the appearance of traditional roofing materials while delivering metal roofing's performance benefits. Available in styles mimicking slate, wood shake, or clay tile, these options suit homes where traditional aesthetics are desired with modern performance.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Corrugated and R-Panel Metal</h3>
            <p>
                Corrugated and R-panel metal roofing provides cost-effective protection with distinctive appearance. These options work well for shops, garages, and properties where exposed fastener systems are acceptable, offering excellent value with proven durability.
            </p>

                Metal roofing requires appropriate substrate preparation. We inspect and repair roof decking as needed, install proper underlayment, address ventilation requirements, and ensure the foundation for your metal roof meets exact specifications.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>
            
            <h3>Quality Trim and Flashing Work</h3>
            <p>
                Trim and flashing represent critical components of any metal roofing system. We fabricate and install custom trim pieces, properly seal all penetrations, ensure proper water drainage, and create clean, finished appearances at all roof edges and transitions.
