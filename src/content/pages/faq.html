                            A new roof in Edmonds, WA typically costs $10,000–$16,000 for a standard asphalt-shingle roof on an average-sized home, with simpler jobs sometimes under $10,000 and more complex or premium-material roofs exceeding $20,000. Prices vary mainly based on roof size, complexity, materials, and any needed structural repairs. Overall, Edmonds’ proximity to the Seattle area also pushes labor and permitting costs slightly higher.

                            Standard homeowners insurance in Washington (including around Seattle) typically does cover roof damage if it was caused by a “covered peril,” 
                            such as a windstorm, hail, lightning, falling objects (like a tree branch), fire, or heavy ice/snow load. On the other hand, damage from normal wear and tear, 
                            slow leaks, lack of maintenance, or age-related deterioration is usually not covered.

                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                           You can prevent moss growth on your roof by keeping it clean, and well-maintained. 
                           Trim back overhanging branches to reduce shade and improve airflow, then regularly clear debris like leaves and needles that trap moisture. 
                           For long-term prevention, consider installing zinc or copper strips along the roof ridge, as rainwater activates these metals
                           and naturally inhibits moss growth.
